    <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage our
      thoughts and feelings, and how we can manage them in relation to ourselves
      and to others. It allows us to understand the feelings of those around us,
      aiding us to relate to them and hence strengthens those relationships
      through a mutual understanding of any obstacles before us.

    <h4>How is EQ different to IQ?</h4>
    <p>
      While IQ largely deals with our ability to process information and
      problem-solve, EQ is more applicable to our mental wellbeing. It is one
      thing to solve a problem, but if you can't solve a problem without
      throwing everyone around you under the bus, or alienating yourself from
      others through impersonal languageâ€¦ really all you've done is created a
      new problem for yourself: everyone now thinks you're an asshole.

    <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
    <p>
      EQ helps us connect with our work colleagues, friends, family, strangers,
      etc. The old adage rings true here - if you want to go fast go alone, but
      if you want to go far go together. By being able to understand how one
      another feels about different things, we are better able to navigate any
      conflict which may arise, we can build stronger relationships to those
      around us, and we can better grapple with our own internal struggles that
      we face each day.
