    <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Websites are made up of many different elements assembled together. There
      are many ways you can tweak these elements to work for you, and margin,
      border and padding are just a few. In short, they make up the distance
      between your content, the edge of the content, and the other elements
      surrounding your content. This isn’t a great explanation, so let’s think
      about it a little differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s imagine a typical suburban property. Think of the house as your
      <b>content</b> - this could be text, images, whatever you like! Now let’s
      put a fence around the property; this is the <b>border.</b> The yard - or
      area between the house and the fence - is what we in coding call the
      <b>padding.</b> Finally, you might have a berm or the like outside the
      fence; this is the <b>margin.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Fingers crossed that painted a bit of a better picture for you. Now let’s
      see it in action using the body of the website you are currently looking
      at as an example:
    </p>
    <h3>Border</h3>
    <p>
      For my website, I wanted to have a solid red border that was 2 pixels wide
      surrounding the body of the page. To do this, I used the following code:
    </p>
    <img src="/images/border-tut.png" class="center" />
    <h3>Padding</h3>
    <p>
      When making this page I didn’t want to have everything hard up against the
      edge of the page, so I would often use a code such as this to give it a
      bit of room to breathe:
    </p>
    <img src="/images/padding-tut.png" class="center" />
    <h3>Margin</h3>
    <p>
      Similarly, I wanted the border to sit within the webpage a bit so I added
      a 25 pixels margin using this code here:
    </p>
    <img src="/images/margin-tut.png" class="center" />
    <p>
      Aaaand ta-da! You’re looking at the result of this work right now! It’s
      pretty simple once you break it down like that huh?
