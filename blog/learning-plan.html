    <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
    <p>
      At this point I'd love to get into software development. I couldn't tell
      you how many times I've been using a program like Ableton and thought,
      "Man, I wish this could do x y and z!" So my thinking now isâ€¦ why not
      discover how to make those features myself?

    <h4>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I know that I have an attentive eye to detail in all I do, but I also know
      that I can procrastinate like it is nobody's business. I can usually
      squash that limitation when a deadline is set, as I often find being left
      to my own devices is when I will slack off the most.

    <h4>
      What skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
      Academy?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I believe I need to work on my collaboration skills a bit, as I have grown
      quite used to working in isolation following the pandemic and also my time
      as a theatre designer. In that environment, most collaborations are done
      at checkpoints and not consistently across a process. Strengthening my
      ability to work consistently with others on a project will no doubt help
      as I progress into the workforce.

    <h4>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </h4>
    <p>
      While we were informed that we just need to finish all the Foundations
      sprints by the end of Foundations, I'm pushing to finish one sprint a
      week. This may stretch and shrink in places, but I currently aim to have
      everything done by Sunday night. This means I can focus on one block at a
      time, rather than letting things snowball and having one hell of a final
      week of Foundations.
    </p>

    <h4>
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I've used the Dev Academy discord channel a few times already when I got
      stuck. I'm also relying heavily on various websites to help me get a
      better grasp on things when I find myself getting hung up for too long.

    <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h4>
    <p>
      I expect the Facilitation team to pull me up on things when they see I'm
      going a bit off-course. I understand this is a largely independent and
      self-directed course, but I also know it's easy to develop bad habits and
      that's something I would love to be swayed away from whenever possible.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I've largely blocked out the rest of the year for this course. This meant
      stepping down from my roles in a few creative projects, which I will admit
      was a tough sacrifice. Any productions I'm still on have been informed of
      my commitment to my studies, and as such I'll only be attending meetings
      and rehearsals at agreed times and will not be able to do much more beyond
      that. I've found that means I can focus on what needs to get done without
      getting too lost in the artistic sauce, per se.
