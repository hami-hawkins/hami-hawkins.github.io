    <h1>Learning Plan (Bootcamp)</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I'm getting more of an inkling for video game development as my end goal.
      Currently I feel like there could be more for me in that world, however I
      can't articulate right now why I think that is. I think it most likely
      lies in my personal connection to video games, and the benefit I have seen
      them have in my own life. It helped me learn problem-solving,
      self-motivating, and ultimately - it brings me joy that I want to give
      back to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I will do best working with and alongside others, after struggling
      working in isolation these past few months. Now I'll be surrounded by like
      minds working toward similar goals, being able to help and get help from
      others as and when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the flip side of that, my time management is gonna give me a rought
      time for sure. I've become quite used to doing things in my own time,
      taking long breaks, having a nap. That won't be an option in Bootcamp. How
      am I going to navigate that? Stay tuned to find out...
    </p>
    <p>
      I think my social anxiety may prove to be a barrier, particularly taking
      in front of people. I've had some nasty experiences of this in the past,
      but I'm trying to remind myself that we are all going through this
      together. No one is coming along just to laugh at me, and I won't be doing
      that for them either.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect a fair bit of support from the Bootcamp team around supporting
      our learning and getting us past any roadblocks we might run into. I'd
      also hope they aren't too harsh with their feedback. So far this hasn't
      been an issue - I've felt nothing but encouranged whenever I asked for
      help - but I fear if I do stumble here or there, it might not be received
      so kindly for whatever reason. I want to be pulled up when I've fucked up,
      or when I'm developing some bad habits. Just a little tap in the right
      direction will be more than enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm going to do my best in bootcamp. I can't guarantee that's always going
      to be good enough to get by, but if I give it my all then that will be
      enough for me. That means getting better at time management, getting
      better at speaking in front of more than one or two people, and of course
      improving on my technical skills. I will graduate something for once in my
      life and I will feel proud about it. YEAH.

    <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
    <p>
      At this point I'd love to get into software development. I couldn't tell
      you how many times I've been using a program like Ableton and thought,
      "Man, I wish this could do x y and z!" So my thinking now isâ€¦ why not
      discover how to make those features myself?
    </p>

    <h4>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I know that I have an attentive eye to detail in all I do, but I also know
      that I can procrastinate like it is nobody's business. I can usually
      squash that limitation when a deadline is set, as I often find being left
      to my own devices is when I will slack off the most.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>
      What skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
      Academy?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I believe I need to work on my collaboration skills a bit, as I have grown
      quite used to working in isolation following the pandemic and also my time
      as a theatre designer. In that environment, most collaborations are done
      at checkpoints and not consistently across a process. Strengthening my
      ability to work consistently with others on a project will no doubt help
      as I progress into the workforce.
    </p>

    <h4>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </h4>
    <p>
      While we were informed that we just need to finish all the Foundations
      sprints by the end of Foundations, I'm pushing to finish one sprint a
      week. This may stretch and shrink in places, but I currently aim to have
      everything done by Sunday night. This means I can focus on one block at a
      time, rather than letting things snowball and having one hell of a final
      week of Foundations.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I've used the Dev Academy discord channel a few times already when I got
      stuck. I'm also relying heavily on various websites to help me get a
      better grasp on things when I find myself getting hung up for too long.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h4>
    <p>
      I expect the Facilitation team to pull me up on things when they see I'm
      going a bit off-course. I understand this is a largely independent and
      self-directed course, but I also know it's easy to develop bad habits and
      that's something I would love to be swayed away from whenever possible.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I've largely blocked out the rest of the year for this course. This meant
      stepping down from my roles in a few creative projects, which I will admit
      was a tough sacrifice. Any productions I'm still on have been informed of
      my commitment to my studies, and as such I'll only be attending meetings
      and rehearsals at agreed times and will not be able to do much more beyond
      that. I've found that means I can focus on what needs to get done without
      getting too lost in the artistic sauce, per se.
