      In 1984, Tā Mason Durle developed <b>Te Whare Tapa Whā</b> as a way to
      better understand the core elements of wellbeing, through the lens of Te
      Ao Māori. This is depicted as a wharenui shown below:

      Below is how I intend to use each part of this model to support myself
      through my studies with Dev Academy.

    <h4>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h4>
    <p>
      Through working in live events for over a decade, I grew quite used to
      working late at night. This meant I would be most awake and alert from the
      evening onwards, while being quite drowsy during the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been working to change this; I now try to activate myself earlier in
      the day, and have implemented an approximate bedtime for myself. By doing
      this, I've developed better sleep hygiene and find I'm more switched on
      during the day and becoming tired at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal by the time I reach bootcamp (which is only three weeks away now),
      I aim to have this nailed down. This will help me both personally and
      professionally as I progress through this course and later into the
      workforce.
    </p>

    <h4>Taha Hinengaro (Mental and Emotional Wellbeing)</h4>
    <p>
      I've spent a fair bit of time in therapy over the past few years working
      on my mental health. My favourite tool I've acquired from this is
      journalling. It enables me to process things externally by putting pen to
      paper, and has helped me work through many things. This is another thing
      I've committed to continuing so I can feel good in myself and my mind.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h4>
    <p>
      As part of my journalling I like to list a few things I'm grateful for
      that day. It can be as little as <em>"I have a roof over my head"</em> or
      even <em>"My flat cat loves me as much as I love it"</em>. All that is
      important is I can find two or three things that bring a bit of light to
      my life and my day.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>Taha Whānau (Family and Social Wellbeing)</h4>
    <p>
      I enjoy staying in touch with my siblings as much as I can. One of my
      preferred ways to do this is through a quick phone call with each of them.
      I enjoy hearing where they're at in life, what's new for them, who the
      latest love interest is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though I don't get to see them as much as I'd like, it fulfils me to
      know they're doing well, or being able to help them when they aren't. I am
      the eldest boy, after all.

    <h4>Whenua (Nature Wellbeing)</h4>
    <p>
      I grew up in Paekakariki - a little beachside town not far from Wellington
      - so I've always enjoyed a nature stroll. It grounds me, and that fresh
      air hits like nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      I live in the city now, which is a bit less chill than that cozy little
      town was. Even still, I enjoy going for a walk most days - sometimes with
      music, sometimes without - where I'll just wander and soak in all that is
      around me. This will all outlive me but it's a privilege to soak as much
      of it in as I can while I can.
