    </h4>
    <p>
      Let's start off hot, shall we? In 2018 my father passed away from cancer.
      It was a quick affair, from being diagnosed in March and passing in
      August, and ultimately left me as "the man of the house" (although I do
      hate that rather archaic patriarchal way of thinking). For my siblings and
      I, dad passing brought out many old and new demons within us all. My
      younger brother fell into a deep pit of depression which resulted in a
      troubling drug addiction. I no longer recognised him as my brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night when we were alone, I decided to speak with him. Calmly and
      rationally, I told him about how his behaviour was affecting us all and
      how despite all the help we offered him he just wasn't listening. I made
      the impossibly hard call that he was no longer welcome in our family while
      he remained a risk to us - a decision I had spent weeks deliberating on.
      On the one hand, he was my brother and I should love him conditionally; on
      the other hand, he was a serious threat to our family. Ultimately I knew
      what had to be done. I told him he should go away for a while and process
      what he is feeling, which he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent nearly a year away from Wellington, living with relatives up
      north and working through his feelings in a new place. He would eventually
      return, and has since become a better person, free of any unhealthy
      addictions and now has a much more wholesome, healthier lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back, I'm so glad I made the call that I made. Without it, there's
      no knowing just how out of hand things could have gotten. Doing what is
      right is hardly ever the same as doing what is easy, and I am so glad I
      understood this at the time. I know we made our father proud as a family.

    <h4>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I consider myself to have lived in two different communities in my
      lifetime: a Christian church, and the Wellington theatre community.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent about ten years growing up in the church. While I no longer
      consider myself religious, I still champion a lot of the values I learnt
      during those years. I learnt kindness to your fellow man, the humility of
      the self, and the significance of honesty. At one point as a guitarist I
      joined the church youth band, and later the main band. Through the band I
      was able to hone my craft through collaboration in songwriting, and
      developed a sense of trust in your fellow artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's no wonder, then, that I would go on to join the theatre community in
      Wellington. Collaboration is the name of the game in the arts, and I was
      able to practice this skill across dozens upon dozens of productions.
      Through working with others, I was reminded of the importance of
      perspective - theatre is essentially a medium to convey new perspectives
      to audiences on situations, worlds, or ideas that they may or may not be
      familiar with. Through making art, we also allow ourselves the opportunity
      of bringing our own shared experiences to a work. Your mind can be changed
      in a few hours, if you only let it.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these communities might seem like polar opposites, there is a lot of
      crossover. I believe each of these communities helped me to hone my craft
      as an artist, as a collaborator, and as a person.

    <h4>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I believe my three core strengths to be my ability to stay calm under
      pressure, my attention to detail, and my sense of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been told in several different work environments that I "always seem
      so chill no matter what" - and if you've ever worked in theatre you know
      how much that means! My personal reasoning for this is understanding that
      nothing adds to a stressful situation quite like a person exuding stress.
      It is totally normal to feel stress, but there are better ways to deal
      with it than brooding around or cussing up a storm. Due to this course
      being quite hard and fast, I'm sure this will benefit me greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a tendency for being a perfectionist helps too. I'll often spend
      hours poring over the finer details of a project before deciding it's
      finished. In a career so focussed on problem-solving, being able to comb
      through the finer points and identify the sticking points will help me
      along my learning journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of humour is always nice to have. Yes there is a time and place
      for this, but once you know the right time for it, it can help cultivate a
      more comfortable learning environment for myself and my fellow students.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h4>
    <p>
      I'll be the first to tell you that I lack self-discipline. I'm inclined to
      a binge, to a nap, to a bit (or a lot) of procrastination. I find I need a
      definitive deadline in order to get things done, and even then I will
      often leave things until the last minute to get it done. For instance, I'm
      finishing up this Sprint 1 module on Sunday afternoon. This is something
      that could make things harder for me in this course, but it is one I
      intend to work on throughout my time here.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h4>
    <p>
      When I was a student at drama school, I was the lighting designer for a
      production with a rather difficult director. They gave me a lot of free
      reign at first, nurturing and developing my ideas alongside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it finally came to realise the design, they decided they were no
      longer happy with it and cut about half the work I had done across the
      prior six months. This was incredibly disheartening, especially in a
      learning environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      With lighting being a visual medium, it can be very difficult to translate
      to a verbal context (seeing is believing, and all that) so I can at least
      partially understand why the director may have been apprehensive. But
      theatre is also about taking risks! As a result of this, I decided to just
      follow through with some decisions that I had made and ignore their
      judgment. In most cases this worked out for me, as I was able to prove my
      ideas were worthy of merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps now I would inquire a bit more as to why they had a change of
      heart, or ask if they could explain their perspective a bit more. It may
      have allowed me to come at things from a different angle, or perhaps we
      could have come up with some compromise, or create new ideas we're both
      happy with.
