      Wha are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li class="li-blog">My ego often hinges on whether I can pick things up with ease or not, quickly falling apart when the latter is the case.</li>
        <li class="li-blog">I do not have as much difficulty connecting with strangers as I first thought.</li>
        <li class="li-blog">I have been living without a robust support system or network for quite some time.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>
      What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h3>
    <p>There are many reasons why empathy and self-awareness in particular are core to learning and programming. Having a supportive environment when learning something as difficult as programming is so vital to retaining information. If you're not getting something and those around you simply ask <em>"Are you dumb / what's not to get / it's so easy though",</em> that's just not helpful. You also need to be considerate when writing code - you want to make it as easy as possible for another programmer to read and tweak as needed. If you write it solely for yourself, it is essentially useless.</p>

    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>I was a little shook at how important it was to have this be a part of the curriculum. I didn't expect how important it was for employers either, but with a bit more thought of course it makes sense. Why would you want to hire a big-brain asshole when you could hire a mid-brain friendly fella?</p>

    <h3>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>Time management always has been and perhaps always will be a massive challenge for me. I have a painfully fluid sense of time, so putting time boxes and the likes on things always adds a layer of stress to things for me.</p>
    <p>I like to  take my time with things, take breaks when I want to, and finish things in my own time. I think this largely comes from my time as a designer for theatre, where yes there are deadlines, but up until then things can be pretty fluid. It isn't very efficient, but it's what I've known. I haven't cracked this egg yet but I think I still can.</p>

    <h3>
      Why do you think we, a programming school are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
    <p>I mentioned it earlier, but again: it's important to think of others when coding. We will so often be working collaboratively when programming, that it is beyond essential to be good at working with others. You also need to be able to hand something off to someone else to work on without needing to hold their hand through it. Make it clean, make it concise, make it digestable. If you don't know how to interact with others, you're going to have a really hard time at doing any of this.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
      instead?
    </h3>
    <p>It doesn't feel like a waste of time to have done this work, but it was a wake-up call that not everyone inherently have these skills. I consider myself grateful to already have an understanding a lot of these, but I can look back and know I didn't always. I learnt them through my lived experience, and my experience is unique to me. Not everyone was as lucky (or unlucky, in some cases) as I was.</p>
    <p>If nothing else, working on human skills has been a good solidifying of skills I already believe myself to have.</p>
