    <h1>Problem-Solving</h1>
    <hr />
    <h4>Problem?</h4>
    <p>
      There was one time working on the Javascript Kata during sprint 4 that
      asked me to make a pretty simple function involving a loop. I felt pretty
      confident in solving it so I went ahead, but when I ran the test, it kept
      coming back as failed. So I'd try something else, and it would fail. Tried
      again, failed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This loop (ba-dum-tss) went on for maybe an hour, during which I had
      googled for help and even resorted to ChatGPT to talk me through the
      problem. Everywhere I looked I was proven that I was doing everything I
      was supposed to, so what the hell was going on?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I threw a screenshot into the foundations help desk channel on
      Discord and a tutor pointed out two things:
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, for whatever reason VSCode had imported something from somewhere,
      despite me not asking to. Gerard pointed it out and got me to remove it.
      Surely that fixed it, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>WRONG.</b> What had also happened was, I had created my function just
      fine. What I hadn't noticed was that there was already a function a few
      lines down, empty, waiting for me to put my code in it. This second
      function was the one the test was reading, completely ignoring my work so
      far. Gerard was kind enough to point this out to me too, which was a real
      <em>d'oh</em> moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral of the story here is to read over your code,
      <b>CAREFULLY.</b> This all could have been avoided had I just read the
      rest of the page before starting and noticed there was already a function
      ready for me to put my code into.
    </p>

    <h4>Problem solved</h4>
    <p>
      Let's pretend for a moment that I didn't get stuck on that problem above.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was first presented with it, I used a bit of pseudocode to break
      down what it was I should be doing to solve it; all of a sudden, I
      realised... this looks familiar. I flicked back to a previous repo we'd
      worked on a week or so ago - something I've noticed is quite useful for
      solidifying my learning - and I found almost exactly the same thing in a
      previous task.
    </p>
    <p>
      From here, I instantly knew that I had to do a simple
      <b>if, else if, else</b> conditional. It took me about ten minutes from
      start to finish (again, aforementioned problems aside). It was an
      incredibly validating moment in my coding journey.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h4>How are you at solving the problems?</h4>
    <p>
      The techniques I'm finding most useful when solving problems with my code
      are <b>pseudocode, googling,</b> and
      <b>asking the tutors for help,</b> usually in that order. When first
      trying to digest a problem, using pseudocode to break a problem down into
      chunks will often help me piece together what it is I need to get things
      working. When that fails, I'll turn to Google to try and see some examples
      of similar code in action and see if I can take those examples and apply
      them to my own work.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all else fails, I'll turn to the Discord for help. Putting my
      problems here mean my tutors and fellow classmates can guide me to the
      answer rather than providing it for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Reading error messages</b> is something I'm slowly getting the hang of,
      although I'm still struggling to understand what they're saying at times.
      I need to improve on being able to pull the important details out to help
      me along.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>rubber ducky method</b> is one thing I do find useful, but don't
      use as often as I should. I seem to be doing it as a last resort, despite
      it solving my problems 80% of the time... go figure, that's a me problem.
      Sort it out, Hamahuna.
    </p>

    <h4>What about a helping hand?</h4>
    <p>
      I've been able to ask for help in the Discord a few times so far, but it
      took a kick in the pants from the tutors to really lean into it. Folks
      studying alongside me seemed to also be avoiding asking questions until
      the tutors actively encouraged more questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it's an anxiety thing, not knowing how to do something and feeling
      shame from it. It can be hard when studying in isolation like this to know
      if you're falling behind or not, so putting yourself out there like that
      can feel quite vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really just need to put that insecurity aside and ask for help,
      otherwise I will begin to fall behind. This early in the course, that is
      something I really hope to avoid.
