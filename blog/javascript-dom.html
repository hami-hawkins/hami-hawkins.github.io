    <h1>Javascript & DOM</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      By now we have a basic understanding of HTML (the content of our page) and
      the CSS (the styling of our page), but surprise! - there's a secret third
      thing we need to talk about, and that is Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
      In simpler terms, imagine we're wanting to record a song. If the lyrics
      and song structure are the HTML, and the musicians with their instruments
      are the CSS, then Javascript is the producer in the studio using its
      specialised know-how to give the track some "oomph". It can isolate
      elements within the song, completely change others, amongst other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's dig a bit further into some of those special abilities only
      Javascript can provide.
    </p>

    <h4>Control Flow & Loops</h4>
    <p>
      Computers like order, and that is essentially all that Control Flow is: it
      is the order in which our computer reads any script we give it. Starting
      from line 1 it will progress through our script executing any and all
      commands or statements until it reaches the final line... unless we tell
      it to do something different, that is! So what does that look like?
    </p>
    <p>
      One such example is what is known as a loop. Loops are exactly what they
      sound like - a chain of commands that will repeat, until such a time as we
      tell them to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine you're hosting 4 friends and offer to get everyone a glass of
      water. A loop in this instance would look something like:
    </p>
    <img src="/images/loop-demo.png" class="center" />
    <p>
      We start with no glasses of water, and know we need four glasses so we can
      stop once we have that many. Each time we fill a glass up, our count will
      increase by one. The loop will repeat this process until we have four
      glasses, and then everyone can hydrate (so they don't dydrate!)
    </p>

    <h4>What the hell is the DOM?</h4>
    <p>
      Think of the Document Object Model (DOM) as the central nervous system for
      your webpage. Look at the diagram below to see what a (very) basic DOM
      might look like:
    </p>
    <img src="/images/dom-eg.png" class="center" />
    <p>
      Our document is the webpage, and all the little nodes that make up our
      webpage anchor back to this. Because of this, we are able to use the DOM
      to find and manipulate each individual node in whatever way we want - we
      can even change how a node renders on our webpage, without touching the
      CSS file!
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, say we want to change all our p nodes to render with red
      text. To do this we could use the following code:
    </p>
    <img src="/images/dom-manip-test.png" class="center" />
    <p>
      What is happening here is we are asking the document to find and select
      ALL p elements, and changing the style of these p elements to red.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth noting that if we had not specified querySelector<b>All</b>,
      only the first p element would have been changed. Be specific, y'all!
    </p>

    <h4>Arrays and Objects</h4>
    <p>Arrays can be understood as a ordered list of items, written like so:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center; color: rgb(194, 149, 0)">
      ['Lay', 'These', 'Foolish', 'Ambitions', 'To', 'Rest']
    </p>
    <p>
      One unique thing about how arrays work is that the first entry is not [1]
      but [0] - because coders are silly and like to start counting from zero,
      apparently... for now, let's just pretend that's a normal thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that understood, we can see that [0] is "Lay", [1] is "These", [2] is
      "Foolish", and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects, on the other hand, are like a container of information, which we
      call key-value pairs. Below is an example of an object for collecting my
      contact details. See if you can identify what part is the key and what is
      the value!
    </p>
    <img src="/images/object-eg.png" class="center" style="width: 20%" />
    <p>
      If you guessed that the key is things like
      <em>name, preferred, age,</em> and <em>phone</em>, you'd be correct! As
      such, the information next to them is the value. Say I had several other
      contact details and I wanted to know everyones preferred name, I could
      call on the key-values of these objects to get that information. This is
      great as it is much faster than combing through the code myself - work
      smarter, not harder!
    </p>

    <h4>Functions</h4>
    <p>
      Why write the same bit of code over and over if you don't have to?
      Ultimately this is the purpose of functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we know we are going to need our code to run something multiple times,
      we can simply write a function for it and call it whenever we need it
      later on down the line. This also means if our function bugs out for
      whatever reason, we are only having to change a single function rather
      than the same one in several different lines of code...
    </p>
    <img src="/images/bugs.jpg" class="center img-border" style="width: 20%" />
    <p>So yeah, just do it once and call on it again later, alright bestie?</p>
