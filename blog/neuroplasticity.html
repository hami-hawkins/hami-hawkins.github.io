    <h4>What is Neuroplasticity?</h4>
    <p>For a long time it was thought that our brains are permanently the way they are once the initial connections 
    have been formed during childhood; this is absolutely not the case. Neuroplasticity enables individuals to learn 
    new skills and adjust their habits through practice and a bit of elbow grease.
    </p>
    <p class="quote"><em>"“Neuroplasticity” refers to your brain’s ability to restructure or rewire itself when it 
    recognizes the need for adaption. In other words, it can continue developing and changing throughout life."</em></p>

      I was developing my own neuroplasticity recently before I even know what neuroplasticity was. For about a 
      year I had my TV and PS5 set up so I could play in bed whenever I wanted. At first while this seemed like 
      a good idea, I found I was never getting tired when playing at night and could go until the early hours of 
      the morning. </p>
    </p>
    <p>By moving my console to my desk and only gaming there, I quickly found that I was getting tired again, 
      and that whenever I lay in bed I would want to sleep. I had essentially rewired my brain to once again 
      recognise that bed = sleep, rather than bed = desk, couch, and then sometimes sleep. My improved sleep 
      hygiene is just one instance of neuroplasticity working for me.</p>
    <p>There are a few ways to increase your own neuroplasticity, such as:

      <li class="li-blog"><b>Go adventuring:</b> less internationally, and more "walk through another neighbourhood or do your shopping in a different town"</li>
      <li class="li-blog"><b>Playing video games:</b> "GIT GUD" isn't a meme, it's a lifestyle</li>

    <h4>What is a Growth Mindset?</h4>
    <p class="quote"><em>The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when 
      it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to 
      thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.</em></p>

    <p>A growth mindset is what happens when we consciously allow ourselves to continue learning. When we 
      can't wrap our heads around something, rather than saying, "I failed" we might instead say "I don't 
      understand this yet." That 'yet' part is the most important element of a growth mindset - it is 
      accepting that while we may not know something in this moment, we are being gracious towards ourselves, 
      giving us the chance to learn it still.</p>
    <p>Now for an example from my own life:
    </p>
    <p>I've been playing a lot of Elden Ring lately, and it surprised me just how much a growth mindset has helped me get through what can at times be quite a slog of a video game. Every time I see that dastardly <b style="color: red">YOU DIED</b> pop up on my screen, rather than yeeting my controller into orbit I am taking a breath, taking a moment, and thinking "Bugger, maybe next time." </p>
    <p>And you know what? It might not be next time, but that is okay - because it might just be the time after that.</p>

    <p>Already in this course I've hit a few roadblocks that I just can't seem to get through at first. I might want to give up at first, but I'm doing my best to go back over the work and see what it is I'm not getting. I might not be able to solve it on my own sometimes, and that is where my classmates and my tutors come in handy. I am not alone on this learning journey, so asking for help when I need it is another way I'm helping develop a better growth mindset for myself.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>I've already spoken about how I intend to use the discord channel to help me when I'm getting stuck rather than giving up. This will further my growth mindset, and will hopefully snowball into me feeling more confident in the work I complete.</p>
    <p>I also intend on stretching my neuroplasticity a bit by spending a bit of time reworking my website a bit. This will help me to solidify my learning from the past few weeks, furthering my ability to learn new things as the course progresses.</p>
